# Some PostgreSQL Queries for a Casual Mobile Game

This repository contains a collection of PostgreSQL queries designed to extract insights and support analytics for a casual mobile game. Each query is crafted for a specific purpose, contributing to dashboards and reports built in Looker Studio. These dashboards help analyze key game metrics, player behavior, and in-game economy, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Repository Structure

Each `.sql` file in this repository represents a standalone query with a specific purpose. 


## Folder Organization

- Each `.sql` file contains:  
  - **The SQL Query:** Fully formatted and ready to use in PostgreSQL.  
  - **Purpose and Description:** A comment block at the bottom of each file explains the objective of the query and its relevance to the overall analytics strategy.
 

## How These Queries Are Used

Each query generates a table in **PostgreSQL** that is directly linked to **Looker Studio** for visualization and reporting. These tables form the backbone of interactive dashboards, each focusing on a different aspect of game analytics, such as:

1. **Performance Monitoring:**  
   Track daily and long-term KPIs like DAU, MAU, ARPU, retention rates, and revenue trends.

2. **Player Behavior:**  
   Understand how players progress through levels, engage with features, and spend in the game.

3. **Monetization:**  
   Optimize the balance between ad revenue and in-app purchases by analyzing player spending and ad performance.

4. **Game Economy:**  
   Ensure a sustainable and engaging in-game economy by balancing resource flows.

5. **Technical Insights:**  
   Monitor game stability and crashes to prioritize fixes.
